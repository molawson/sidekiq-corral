# These commits should be ignored by git-blame, making it much easier to step through the history
# of a line without hitting formatting commits (esp. large, update-all-the-files sorts of commits).
#
# For git-blame to ignore these revisions, you'll need to tell it about this file.
#
# You can either pass it to the command each time:
#   git blame --ignore-rev-file=.git-blame-ignore-revs -L 1,9 lib/conversions.rb
#
# Or you can set it as a config value, which will be used by all git-blame commands going forward:
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
